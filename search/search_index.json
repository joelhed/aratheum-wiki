The first generations of beings with the latent ability to tap Entra were strong. They could fold the earth into mountains or make the seas boil with their power.

As more millenia passed, even the Knowledge of Entra\u2019s existence was lost. In this New Age, all but small wisps of Entra remain. Many citizens of Valmere still have the latent ability to tap Entra, but only very rare individuals have enough talent to tap even a small amount of Entra. Most who have the ability go their whole lives without ever realizing. These individuals are called Astras by the few that still know of Entra.

Even though War brews in the Valmere midlands, greater forces work in the shadows, attempting to bring Magic back into the World.

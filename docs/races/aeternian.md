# Aeternians

Aeternians are a mechanical race created by powerful Magi during the Age of Legends. With perfect memory, physical aptitude, and mental acuity, they were the perfect servants to sorcerers during their studies of Entra.

## The Undying

Some time after their creation, a large number of Aeternians rebelled against their masters, sparking a war. Eventually, freed from their servitude, the Aeternians created their own society, living apart from the rest of the world.

One day, known as the [Excidium](excidium.md), every Aeternus on the face of Valmere vanished. No one knows how or why the Excidium occurred, the only evidence the Aeternians existed in the first place the civilization they left behind.

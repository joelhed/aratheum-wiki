Arkesh is filled with deep-rooted history of the beginnings of the Empire, apparent in the architecture, historical statues, and strong presence of [Vel Resh](vel_resh.md). This rich historical influence has melded into a more diverse impact via an influx of immigration from tribes in the [Saurkar Desert](saurkar_desert.md) and [the Free Cities of Dei](the_free_cities_of_dei.md) to the north and northwest. It's distance from [Roshkas](roshkas.md) and the heart of the Empire has allowed the city to become a more independent power within the Empire. It is one of the few cities in the Empire that has maintained its trade relationship with [Ilris](ilris.md) in spite of recent wars.

## Government

Arkesh, being under the rule of the Empire, is run by a [Magistrate](antuza_magistrate.md), answering directly to the Emperor. The Magistrate delegates the tasks of running the city to the Ministry, a group of individuals hand-selected by the Magistrate themselves. The Ministry rules the city alongside the Wardens, and organization responsible for law and justice in the city. The Wardens are run by an Overseer. Typically this appointment is held by a higher ranking officer from the [Antuzan military](antuza_military.md).

Besides the Ministry, Arkesh has two major powers vying for control over the city: The Guild of Commerce, and the Vel Reshi church. Members of Guild of Commerce make up most of the city's uppercrust, running the city through taxation and oppression. Although the city's rich commerce allows for greater diversity of goods available, the cost is that of its common people. The church, on the other hand, takes care of the lower class through public service. Most of it's funding comes from the Empire itself. These two forces create an interesting dichotomy in Arkesh, and often creates tension between conflicting interests.

## Geography
Arkesh is situated near the mouth of the [Makhet river](makhet_river.md), where it feeds into the [Gulf of Dvazdil](gulf_of_dvazdil.md). The city is located in the Makhet river valley, straddled on either side by coastal hills.

## The Catacombs of Linguul 

The [Catacombs of Linguul](catacombs_of_linguul.md) are an enormous complex of ossuaries directly beneath the city. The existed long before Arkesh was built on top of them. In fact, the catacombs were not even discovered until construction of the city had begun. Antuzan archaeologists believe that they must have been built sometime during the [Age of Balance](age_of_balance.md), well over a 4000 years ago. They house the tombs of some of the most prominent historical figures of that time.

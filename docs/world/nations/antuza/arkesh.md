Arkesh is filled with deep-rooted history of the beginnings of the Empire, apparent in the architecture, historical statues, and strong presence of [Vel Resh](vel_resh.md). This rich historical influence has melded into a more diverse impact via an influx of immigration from [the Free Cities](the_free_cities.md) to the northwest. It's distance from [Roshkas](roshkas.md) and the heart of the Empire has allowed the city to become a more independent power within the Empire.

## History

During the period known as [the Divergence](the_divergence.md), [Jeza Daro](jeza_daro.md), a former military strategist for the [Sovereignty](the_sovereignty.md), became a prophet for the god he claimed to know as [Odeth](odeth_god.md). During this period of turmoil, he gained many followers who latched on to the small amount of order and structure he offered, preaching of [the Path](the_path.md).

Eventually, he led a mass exodus from the Valmere midlands across the [Plys sea](plys_sea.md), establishing the city of [Arkesh](arkesh.md). Jeza did not stop there, however. He claimed his god ordered him to march south. And so he led his new nation to the southernmost tip of the peninsula and established [Akim](akim.md).

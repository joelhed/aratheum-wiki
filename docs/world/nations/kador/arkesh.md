# Arkesh

**Arkesh** is the oldest city of the [Kadoran Empire](kador.md), built upon the ruins of an set of catacombs traced back to the [Age of Balance](age_of_balance.md).

Arkesh is filled with deep-rooted history of the beginnings of the Empire, apparent in the architecture, historical statues, and strong presence of [Pathians](the_path.md). This rich historical influence has melded into a more diverse impact via an influx of immigration from [the Free Cities](the_free_cities.md) to the north. It's distance from [Akim](akim.md) and the heart of the Empire has allowed the city to become a more independent power within the Empire.

Arkesh has a strong trade presence at sea due to its location, a likely stop for ships traveling the [Plys](plys_sea.md). [Daro's Landing](daros_landing.md) is boasted as one of the largest ports in [Valmere](valmere.md).

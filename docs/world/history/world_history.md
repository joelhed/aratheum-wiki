# World History

The history of [Valmere](valmere.md) as agreed upon by most [Ilrian](ilris.md) historians is divided into six [Eras](era.md): [the Age of Legend](age_of_legend.md) (*LE*), [the Age of Balance](age_of_balance.md) (*BE*), [the Dark Age](dark_age.md) (*DE*), [the Sovereign Age](sovereign_age.md) (*SE*), and [the Age of Order](age_of_order.md) (*OE*). The following sections break the events of each Era out in greater detail.

## [The Age of Legend](age_of_legend.md) (*LE* , 5,000+ years)

The Age of Legend is the first recognized [Era](era.md) in [Valmere's](valmere.md) history. During this Era, the first humans appeared in Valmere, mainly as hunter-gatherer tribes until the formation of [Imperial Cults](imperial_cults.md). These Imperial Cults were generally always in some state of war as they fought over the land and resources, each fervently loyal to their [Atun](atun.md). 

## [The Age of Balance](age_of_balance.md) (*BE*, ~3,000 years)

The Age of Balance marks the rise of the first coordinated human civilizations, the largest of which was the [Raethani Empire](raeth.md) and the [Veritas Guild](veritas_guild.md). Many technological wonders were created using [Entra](entra.md) during this Era. 

## [The Dark Age](dark_age.md) (*DE*, ~500 years)

The Dark Age was a short Era proceeding the fall of the [Raethan Empire](raeth.md) and the [Veritas Guide](veritas_guild.md), and the loss of [Entra](entra.md). Much of the technological progress during the Age of Balance was lost or destroyed during this time as the remnants of human civilization vied for power.

## [The Sovereign Age](sovereign_age.md) (*SE*, 1678 years)
The Age of Order (O.E, 286 years)
In this new Age of Order, Humanity began to rebuild Erathis from the remnants of the Great War that divided the nation. Science and Politics became the driving forces behind progress.

In the years after the great war, the Roshan Empire grew to one that rivaled the size of Erathis. Only 20 years ago, the current god-king of Roshan waged war against Erathis. In a short two years, Erathis brought the Roshan armies down and pushed them back across the sea.

Now, the Roshan empire has gathered in even larger forces and make landfall in Erathis again. Melek (title for Emperor) Azah, The Whispering Emperor, believes that when the sun rises and sets on Roshan, that Odeth will rise up and bring a new age of Magic to the world, with Azah as his first hand.

In the nearly 300 years since The Age of Balance ended, no Human has seen a single elf. The occasional dwarf will make contact with the Humans of Northern cities such as Northhaven or Goldcrest, but these occurrences are extremely rare.

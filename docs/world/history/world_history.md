# World History

The history of [Asdel](asdel.md) as agreed upon by most [Ilrian](ilris.md) historians is divided into six [Eras](era.md): [the Age of Legend](age_of_legend.md) (*LE*), [the Age of Balance](age_of_balance.md) (*BE*), [the Dark Age](dark_age.md) (*DE*), [the Sovereign Age](sovereign_age.md) (*SE*), and [the Age of Order](age_of_order.md) (*OE*). The following sections break the events of each Era out in greater detail.

## [The Age of Legend](age_of_legend.md) (*LE* , 5,000+ years)

The Age of Legend is the first recognized [Era](era.md) in [Asdel's](asdel.md) history. During this Era, the first humans appeared in Asdel, mainly as hunter-gatherer tribes until the formation of [Imperial Cults](imperial_cults.md). These Imperial Cults were generally always in some state of war as they fought over the land and resources, each fervently loyal to their [Atun](atun.md). 

## [The Age of Balance](age_of_balance.md) (*BE*, ~3,000 years)

The Age of Balance marks the rise of the first coordinated human civilizations, the largest of which was the [Raethani Empire](raeth.md) and the [Veritas Guild](veritas_guild.md) on the continent of [Valmere](valmere.md). Many technological wonders were created using [Entra](entra.md) during this Era. 

## [The Dark Age](dark_age.md) (*DE*, ~500 years)

The Dark Age was a short Era proceeding the fall of the [Raethan Empire](raeth.md) and the [Veritas Guide](veritas_guild.md), and the loss of [Entra](entra.md). Much of the technological progress during the Age of Balance was lost or destroyed during this time as the remnants of human civilization vied for power.

## [The Sovereign Age](sovereign_age.md) (*SE*, 1678 years)

Out of the ashes of the Dark Age rose a collective of city-states, that, in a tentative alliance, formed the [Sovereignty](the_sovereignty.md). This collective remained in relatively peaceful stablity until the formation of the [Antuzan Empire](antuza.md) some 1500 years later, and the [War of Faith](war_of_faith.md), causing the [Divergence](the_divergence.md), the breaking of Sovereignty.

## [The Age of Order](age_of_order.md) (O.E, 286 years)

The Age of Order is the current [Era](era.md) of [Asdel](asdel.md). In this Era, two powerful nations, [Ilris](ilris.md) and [the Antuzan Empire](antuza.md) vie for control over western Valmere. The Antuzan Empire, a theocracy, is on a religious conquest subjucate Ilris and the surrounding regions, thus beginning the [War for the Gate](gate_war.md).

# The Age of Order

**The Age of Order** (*[OE](era.md)* 286 years) is the current Era that [Valmere](valmere.md) is in. 

In this age, [Ilris](ilris.md) has become the main power in the Valmere midlands, slowly rebuilding what was lost during the [War of Faith](war_of_faith.md). The [Kadoran Empire](kador.md) has made tentative trading alliances with the [Free Cities](the_free_cities.md) to the north, and has fully established a theocratic empire in which each Emperor is chosen by the last, each claiming to be a mouthpiece of [Odeth](odeth_god.md).

The tribes in the [Stormfall](stormfall.md) have all but fallen out of contact with the rest of Valmere, their ways now a mystery to the world, living in secret deep within the mountains.

In the year 268 *OE*, the [Kadoran Empire](kador.md) travelled across the [Plys sea](plys_sea.md) and invaded [Ilris](ilris.md). After a short campaign of 18 months, the Kadoran forces retreated, leaving Ilris victorious.

Twenty years later, in the year 286 *OE*, Kador once again invaded Ilris. [Melek](melek.md) [Azah](azah.md), The Whispering Emperor, believes that when the sun rises and sets on Kador, that [Odeth](odeth_god.md) will rise up and bring a new age of magic to the world, with Azah as his first hand.
This time, however, their forces appeared suddenly, without warning, and Ilris was caught unaware, complacent in their victory. The [Siege of Valla](siege_of_valla.md) marked the beginning of a long war that would change Valmere irrevocably, the [War for the Gate](gate_war.md).

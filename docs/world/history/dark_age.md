# The Dark Age

With the [Raethan](raeth.md) realms collapsed, and as the flow of [Entra](entra.md) into the world vanished, [Valmere](valmere.md) was thrown into a period of chaos known as **The Dark Age**. 

In the immediate power vacuum left by [Raeth](raeth.md) and the [Veritas Guild](veritas_guild.md), a multitude of wars broke out as various minor kingdoms vied for power.

Included in the struggle was the surviving sects of the [Church of the Triumvirate](the_church_of_the_triumvirate.md), who sought to gain power in the west. The [Sanguine Order](sanguine_order.md) was founded during this time. At this point, most of the world distrusted the church, and the [Caeteran](caeteran.md) religion fell out of popularity.

Many of the innovations the Raethans created were destroyed during this age, either as collateral damage or deliberate acts to destroy artifacts that many saw as the cause of The Dark Age.

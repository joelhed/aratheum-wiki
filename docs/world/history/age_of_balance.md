# The Age of Balance

The chaos of the [Age of Legend](age_of_legend.md) could only go on for so long, and the presence of [Entra](entra.md) began to stabilize. The world began to calm somewhat, and more stable civilizations were established. Thus, the **Age of Balance** began.

It was during this [Era](era.md) that religion began to shift. As the [Atuns](atun.md) of the Age of Legend died off, they could no longer be worshiped as avatars of gods. Instead, [The Church of the Triumvirate](the_church_of_the_triumvirate.md) was founded, as well as the [Caeteran religion](caeteran.md). Caeteran beliefs revolved around combining [Teldur](teldur_god.md)—a mutation of [Teth](teth_god.md)—, [Ilris](ilris_god.md), and [Nilos](nilos_god.md). Caeteran doctrines helped to guide the people of Valmere into a new age of civilization.

For many years, human civilization continued to push back the wilds. The greatest kingdom that came to power during this Era was [Raeth](raeth.md). The Raethans spread across some seventy-five percent of Valmere during their height, building cities that have lasted even into the modern era. Their Magi, who were a part of a collective known as the [Veritas Guild](veritas_guild.md), created technological wonders with [Entra](entra.md) the likes of which the world had never seen. Flying machines, ways to travel thousands of miles in mere days, and their greatest creation: the [Aeternians](aeternian.md). These advancements allowed the Raethans to become a major power in Valmere, with the Veritas Guild at the seat of power.

The Raethans ruled for millennia, until the [Eternal War](the_eternal_war.md). The Aeternian uprising caused a world war to break out, laying waste to much of civilization. The war raged for over a hundred years, causing much of human civilization's progress to halt and regress. In an event known as [The Excidium](excidium.md), nearly all Aeternians vanished from Valmere, and the Veritas Guild disbanded, most Magi going into hiding, causing the realms of Raeth to collapse. The Excidium is also attributed to the loss of [Entra](entra.md) in Valmere, and also marks the beginning of [The Dark Age](dark_age.md).

# World Overview

Valmere is an old world, and has seen many ages come to pass. In the beginning, the world was filled with a powerful essence known as [Entra](entra.md) *(Eh-ntra)*, the source of Magic in the world. Entra is the embodiment of creation itself, and is the essence that connects all things.

For the denizens of Valmere, Entra was a latent force of the Universe that could be tapped into in order to produce Magic. The first generations of beings with the latent ability to tap Entra were strong. They could fold the earth into mountains or make the seas boil with their power. Over the millenia, Entra slowly dissipated throughout the Universe, meaning the amount of Entra available to Magic users also waned. As more millenia passed, even the Knowledge of Entra’s existence was lost.

In this New Age, all but small wisps of Entra remain. Many citizens of Valmere still have the latent ability to tap Entra, but only very rare individuals have enough talent to tap even a small amount of Entra. Most who have the ability go their whole lives without ever realizing. These individuals are called Astras by the few that still know of Entra.

While the tribes of the [Stormfall Peaks](stormfall_peaks.md) remain quiet and tinker in their Mountains, and the desert clans seclude themselves far out into the Karna Wastes, the armies of the [Kadoran Empire](kador.md) and [Ilris](ilris.md) make war. The Roshans have made landfall near Southern city of Valla, and have begun tearing through villages and towns along the countryside, progressing North towards Achenar, the Capital city of Erathis.

Even though War brews in the Valmere midlands, greater forces work in the shadows, attempting to bring Magic back into the World. With millions of lives across the nations of Valmere unaware of the presence of Entra and their own potential, could a resurgence of Magic in Valmere bring on a new renaissance, or complete chaos?...

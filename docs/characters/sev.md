# Sev

<hr>

Sev is one of the last remaining [Aeternians](aeternian.md) in Valmere. His body is constructed from a smooth stone-like material, making him extraordinarily heavy. His only memories are of the past five years, since being awoken by [Rykker](rykker.md), remembering nothing of his creation or the countless millennia he has survived. Since becoming active, he has taken to being Rykker's assistant, largely due to the fact that Rykker uknowingly began to wear Sev's [Auctor](Auctor.md), a nondescript ring. The Auctor influences Sev's personality and goals to match Rykker's, an ambition and drive to understand the world.

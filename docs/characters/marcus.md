## Personality

## History

### Early Childhood in Tatun

### Enlisting in the Royal Ilrian Military

### First Kadoran Invasion of Ilris 

During his time as a Lieutenant in the Ilrian Military, during the first invasion of [Ilris](ilris.md), Marcus lost his left hand to a [Kadoran](kador.md) by the name of [Jamath](jamath.md). This incident was the result of Marcus' foolish attempt to lead a mission behind enemy lines, hoping to sabotage Kadoran supply lines in an effort to starve out their troops. The supply encampment was more heavily fortified than anticipated, and instead of retreating, Marcus lead his team into the enemy camp, against better judgement. This mistake would haunt him for decades to come, effecting his future leadership style as a Captain. After the war ended, he was fixed with a metal replacement. The prosthetic would become a source of regret and anger.

## Powers and Abilities

Although he resents his prosethic hand for what it represents, over the years it became Marcus' weapon of choice, forgoing more traditional weaponry in favor of hand-to-hand combat, developing a brawler style in which he rushes his opponents in an effort to incapacitate them with his metal fist.

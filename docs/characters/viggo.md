# Viggo

**Viggo** is a field medic in the [Ilrian Military](the_royal_ilrian_military.md). In a previous life, he was known as Ino, growing up as an acolyte in the [The Church of the Triumvirate](the_church_of_the_triumvirate.md). He has a strong will to help others, but often mistrusts authority figures. Although he no longer follows the [Caeteran](caeteran.md) religion, he unwittingly still follows many of their beliefs in balance and equality.

## History

----

### Early Life in the Church
Viggo's childhood with the Church was spent mostly studying the Caetera, history, and medicine. His given name was Ino. Although he grew up without many close friends, he found comfort in his isolation. Prone to reading or writing for hours at a time, he often missed his scheduled studies and would wander the grounds. [Master Renuin](master_renuin.md) took Ino in at a young age, filling a psuedo-father figure role.


### Excommunication
When Ino was in his late teens, he stumbled upon a secretive meeting in a forbidden section of the Church. A Patriarch, [Astos](astos.md) was meeting with  [Lissia](lissia.md), a Seer, and an unnamed woman dressed in rags. The woman performed Magic, manifesting [Entra](entra.md) as Life magic to heal a wound on Lissia's hand.

Ino was caught, and as punishment he was excommunicated from the Church, and threatened to never speak of what he had seen. On that day, he left the Church and never returned, souring his view of the Caetera.

### Smithing Apprenticeship
At some point in his early twenties, Ino changed his name to Viggo and became a smith's apprentice in [Turin](turin.md), gaining possession of a forging hammer that he carried with him into the military. It is unclear why he left his apprenticeship and decided to join Ilrian army.

### Ilrian Military
After leaving Turin, Viggo made his way to [Achenar](achenar.md) to join [The Royal Army](the_royal_ilrian_military.md). He became a medic, utilizing the skills he had learned in medicine during his studies at the church. 

Eventually, he would be drafted into a reserve force of two thousand soldiers to march south to fight in the Siege of [Valla](valla.md).

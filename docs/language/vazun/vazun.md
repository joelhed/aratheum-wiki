# Vazun

**Vazun** (*/vɑzʌɴ/, VA-zuhn*) is a dead language that was once spoken by the [Raethans](raeth.md), first appearing during the [Age of Balance](age_of_balance.md).

Although it was spoken by the population at large, Vazun was largely created and utilized by the [Veritas Guild](veritas_guild.md) to hone their use of [Entra](entra.md).

The runic representations of Vazun can focus the imbuement of Entra, allowing for more powerful or longer-lasting effects.

# Metaphysics of Asdel 

!!! warning "Spoilers Beware"
	The information on this page explains the origins of [Entra](entra.md) in Asdel. It is essentially a meta explaination of how and why magic came to be in the world, and is very spoilery in nature. There are *very* few characters in the world that are aware of the information on this page.

## The Gate

[Atu Valus](atu_valus.md), (*[Vazhun](vazhun.md): Source Gate*), is a physical location on [Asdel](asdel.md), created by an [architect](architect.md) known on-world as [Teth](teth.dmd), or [Teldur](teldur.md) later in history. The sourcegate itself is a dimensional engine that generates spacetime and dictates the laws of the Universe. It is one of many throughout the vast Universe, each one guarded by their own architect.

The sourcegate is nearly as old as the Universe, and Teth even older still. It would be billions of years since the creation of the gates that Teth would betray the [Dominion](dominion.md).

## Creation of Humans

Although architects do not feel mortal, sentient emotions, in the same way, Teth grew "weary" of their duty to watch over the gate. They decided to create sapient life and populate the planet that the gate resided on, a direct violation of [the Plan](the_plan.md).

The template for humans was not a new one---many architects had created their own variations of biological life for their own purposes. In all cases, however, creation oflife was only allowed on non-gate planets.

## Altering of the Gate

Teth had even grander desires for his creations. In further violation of his directive, he altered the gate. In doing so, the gate began to "leak" a physical manifestation of meta-reality, later given the name [Entra](entra.md) by the denizens of Asdel, onto the planet.

This act was Teth's greatest violation, and would eventually attract the attention of other deviant architects.

## Interest of Other Architects

Over time, Teth's experiment drew the attention of two other architects: [Nilos](nilose.md) and [Ilris](ilris.md). Similarly "bored" with their existence, they joined in the experiment, helping to guide Teth's creations.

Nilos chose to construct an "afterlife" for humans---a way to study their souls after death, seeking to learn about the effects of Entra.

Ilris led humanity towards technological progress, seeking to test the limits of what Entra could do, bringing about the rise of the [Raethan Empire](raeth.md).

## The Sealing of the Gate

After thousands of years of experimenting (a short amount of time, given the timescales of architects), the events transpiring on Asdel were discovered by the Dominion. Ilris betrayed their collaborators, and helped incite the [Eternal War](the_eternal_war.md) by speaking to the [Aeternians](aeternian.md) of freedom from their servitude, promising them a way off Asdel. This event will become known as [the Exicidium](excidium.md). Ilris created [Bastion](bastion.md) so that the gate could be sealed and shut off, stopping the flow of Entra.

Teth, Nilos, and Ilris were called away from Asdel after the war to answer for their crimes against the Plan, leaving Asdel to spiral into the [Dark Age](dark_age.md).

With the sourcegate inoperational, the remaining Entra in Asdel has slowly dissapated over the millenia, becoming increasingly more scarce.

## Odeth

The Dominion deliberated over what to do with Asdel for a few thousand years, eventually deciding to send [Odeth](odeth.md), another architect, to deal with the situation. Unable to dismantle Ilris' creation of Bastion, Odeth gave rise to the [Antuzan Empire](antuza.md), created the race of [Scath](scath.md) and the [Vel Resh](vel_resh.md) in order to figure out how to re-open the gate once again.

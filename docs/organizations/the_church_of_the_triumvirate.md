# The Church of the Triumvirate

The Church of the Triumvirate, founded during the Age of Balance. The Church was founded on the belief in the Holy Triumvirate, three deities that created and watch over the World. Their Faith is known as the Caetera, meaning “the Balance.” 

These deities are Teldur, the Creator of the body and natural powers (such as Entra), Erathis, creator of the Mind, civilization, and all things order, and Nilos, the Facilitator of Death, to ensure that the World is always moving forward. During the Age of Balance, the Church was supported widely by the entire nation of ilris, with the majority of the population united under a single religion. It wasn't until the War of Faith that ended the Age of Balance erupted that the Church fell from grace. The Church, and belief in the Triumvirate, slowly faded from the minds of Erathans, choosing to place their faith in the realms of Man. In the modern Age of Order, the Church still operates a fraction of its Temples, but members of the Church mostly keep to themselves, practicing their Faith privately and rarely interacting with the governments of Erathis.

## Faith

The main faith of the Church of the Triumvirate is known as the [Caetera](caeteran.md).

## History

Although the worship of dieties like [Erathis](erathis.md), [Teldur](teldur.md), and [Nilos](nilos.md) has been practiced since the creation of the world, the Caeteran belief system was not created until the [Age of Balance](world_history.md). The Church was founded by a subsect of [Teth](teth.md) worshipers, mutating his name to Teldur and adding Erathis and Nilos to their pantheon.

# Welcome to Valmere

--- 

Valmere is a homebrewed fantasy setting. A world of old Magic and war, Valmere attempts to capture a plethora of fantasy elements from my favorite books and games, and cobbles them together into a somewhat unique mishmash of ideas. 

At one point this setting was used to record a few episodes of a DnD 5E podcast. You can listen in at http://mythsandmongrels.com/
The podcast follows four player characters: [Marcus](marcus.md), a one-handed soldier hardened from years of War, [Rykker](rykker.md), a crossbow wielding tinkerer with a penchant for shooting nobles, [Sev](sev.md), an undying automaton who's lost his memories and his kin, and [Viggo](viggo.md), paladin of the people with a grudge against the Church that cast him out.

The story from the DnD campaign is also being adapted into a book (and maybe someday a few more). As the adaption evolves, this wiki will be updated, and may conflict with content in the original podcast. For now, current progress on the book can be found at http://wordofzach.com/ Updates range from regular to completely infrequent.

See the links below to explore the world of Valmere. I'll be honest, I don't actually expect anyone to visit this website, so if you are: Hi! Thanks for coming.
